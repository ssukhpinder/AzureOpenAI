Learnings include creating Azure Open AI services, deploying GPT models, interacting with GPT in Playground, and optimizing model performance with parameters.

## Introduction

The Microsoft team has recently launched an Open AI challenge, in which a developer can learn how to build Azure AI solutions and apps.

### Prerequisite

* Experience working with Azure and Azure portals.

* An understanding of generative AI.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

Search for Azure Open AI and fill out the following details

### Step 2: Choose Network

### Step 3: Add Tags

For this exercise tag names are not required. But in a production environment, it should be added as it's a best practice.

### Step 4: Review & Create

### Step 5: Move to Open AI Studio

On the left side open Models > Select ‚Äúgpt-35-turbo‚Äù > Deploy as highlighted below

The below model list will be populated based on the access provided by the Microsoft team.

### Azure OpenAI includes:

 1. GPT-4 models: Latest generation for natural language and code completions from prompts.

 2. GPT 3.5 models: Generate language and code completions, with turbo versions for chat interactions.

 3. Embedding models: Convert text to numeric vectors, useful for language analytics.

 4. DALL-E models (preview): Generate images from natural language prompts, automatically available without explicit deployment in Azure OpenAI Studio.

### Step 6: Open Playground

### Step 7: Try Prompts

Input the following prompt in the chat to see if the service is working or not. It may take 5‚Äì10 minutes, please be patient.
> # hi can you tell me about viral kohli

Please find below the response to the above prompt.

### An alternative approach

The whole setup can also be done via the CLI using the following command

    az cognitiveservices account deployment create \
       -g OAIResourceGroup \
       -n MyOpenAIResource \
       --deployment-name MyModel \
       --model-name gpt-35-turbo \
       --model-version "0301"  \
       --model-format OpenAI \
       --sku-name "Standard" \
       --sku-capacity 1

I haven‚Äôt tried the CLI approach but just wanted to mention the other alternative.

### Playground Parameters

Play with playground parameters to change the performance of the model.

### In this module, we learnt

* How to create an Azure Open AI Service.

* How to deploy GPT models.

* How to converse with GPT in the Playground.

* Different approaches to deploying an Open AI service on Azure.

* Playground parameters are available to improve the performance of the model.
